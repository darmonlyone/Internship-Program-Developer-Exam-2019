## Requirement
- Java 8

## Installation

Clone this project and go to the `src` directory, compile java class and run with whit command.

```
> javac *.java
> java Main.class
```

- Somehow this command didn't work well for me either. You can try my jar file that compile and  
build already on `/jar/Hangman.jar`.

- If you want to run my source code you can try with java IDE.
