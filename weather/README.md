# XML to JSON (weather)
XML to Json for Internship develop exam part 2.

### Information
- This application is crate by myself with try not to use any *library*. 
- Read all `xml` line and change to `json` form by changing of string. 
- *json* file did't format well as well as its could.
- Class will ask for `xml` path file and rewrite to `json` file on same directory.

## Requirement
- Java 8

## Installation

Clone this project and go to the `src` directory, compile java class and run with whit command.

```
> javac *.java
> java XMLToJSON.class
```

- Somehow this command didn't work well for me either. You can try my jar file that compile and  
build already on `/jar/XMLToJSON.jar`.

- If you want to run my source code you can try with java IDE.
